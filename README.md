Dom's Hangman

Objective:

The game "Dom's Hangman" is self explanatory if you have played Hangman before ***(If not please see below)***
  
  
User stories:

An array of words is created while a math.random method is implemented to randomize the words in the array.

The function "game" uses user input (ie: Letter (alphabet) clicked is entered into the function and goes through to a eventual letters_guessed text field on the page.

After each letter is clicked, the same letter cannot be clicked twice hence removing the ability to re-enter the same letter into the hangman game.

As each letter is clicked, if correct, it removes the hash(#) mask from the correct letter clicked in the random chosen words in the array.

You have 10 lives, generated by a "for loop". After 10 lives, the game is over.


***Hangman Rules***

1.When a random category is chosen also is a word of that category.
2.When word is chosen, the user has to guess the word with a series of alphabet letters provided.
3.With each correct letter chosen, the word is filled in per letter.
4.If a wrong letter is chosen, a limb or extremity is drawn (ie: Head, leg, eyes, etc)
5.You have a set amount of lives based on the amount of limbs the host decides to draw for each wrong letter chosen.
6.When the word is completely filled out, the game is complete and the User has won the game.
